# House-Price-Prediction-using-regression
I have completed this project while attending a DevTown boot camp. Regression methods are used to predict the price of houses in this repository. DevTown is providing this dataset. Information about 545 houses is provided here. These 13 columns are present in this dataset: Price is the dependent variable that needs to be predicted in this situation. This column provides us with details on the costs of various homes based on various attributes. Area is a second independent variable. This column provides us with details on the whereabouts of numerous houses. 3. Bedrooms: This is another unrelated factor. This column informs us of the number of bedrooms in each of those homes.
