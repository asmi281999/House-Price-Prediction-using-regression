# House-Price-Prediction-using-regression
I have completed this project while attending a DevTown boot camp. Regression methods are used to predict the price of houses in this repository. DevTown is providing this dataset. Information about 545 houses is provided here. These 13 columns are present in this dataset:
1. Price : This is the dependent variable that needs to be predicted in this situation. This column provides us with details on the costs of various houses based on various attributes. 
2. Area : This is the first independent variable. This column provides us with details on the whereabouts of numerous houses. 
3. Bedrooms: This is the second independent variable. This column informs us of the number of bedrooms in each of those houses.
4. Bathrooms: This is the third independent variable. This column informs us of how many bathrooms are present in such residences.
5. Stories: This is the fourth  independent factor. This column informs us of the number of floors in each of those houses.
6. Mainroad: This is the fifth  independent factor. This column informs us whether a main road is located close to those houses.
7. Guestroom: This is the sixth  independent factor. This column informs us whether or not those houses have guest rooms.
8. Basement: This is a separate variable as well. The information on whether or not those houses have basements is provided in this column.
9. Hotwaterheating: This is another uncorrelated variable. This column tells us whether or not those houses have a hot water heating hookup.
10. Airconditioning: This is a separate variable as well. This column informs us whether those houses are connected to the air conditioning system.
11. Parking: This is a further independent variable . This column tells us how many parking spaces each of the houses has.
12. Prefarea: This is a separate variable as well. This column tells us whether or not the houses are located in a preferred area.
13. Furnishingstatus: This is a further independent vaiable. This column informs us on the state of those houses, i.e. whether they are furnished, unfurnished, or partially furnished.
